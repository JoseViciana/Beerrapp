Kotlin app as an example of a search engine in an API (in this case of AI-generated beers), where the use of:

- MVVM Architecture and Clean Architecture.
- Use of Retrofit to consult the API.
- Use of Glide for image loading.
- Use of extension functions.
- Dependency injection with Dagger Hilt.
- Test with Mockk.

How does it work:

• When you enter the name of a beer in the search engine, the search result in a RecyclerView.
• Each time a character is entered or deleted from the search, the list will be updated.
• When you click on a beer on the list, a screen will open with the beer information (name, image, description, degrees).
